# Plotting visual QA

The comparison gallery is generated from small fixtures rendered independently
by ScalaFIM/Java2D and ggplot2. Run:

```sh
tools/render_position_adjustment_qa.sh
```

Open `target/graphics-position-qa/index.html`. The page places sixteen 640 x 480
comparisons side by side without enlarging either renderer's raster:

- filled continuous scatter points;
- grouped continuous lines;
- explicit-break histograms;
- fixed-bandwidth density estimates;
- grouped means with standard-error intervals;
- bounded ribbons;
- explicitly sized and colored tiles;
- a field-native continuous heatmap with a derived colorbar;
- a rectangular 2D count field with fixed one-unit bins;
- a fixed-bandwidth Gaussian 2D density field;
- explicit-level contours extracted from that density field;
- categorical `stat_count` bars;
- a fixed-scale two-panel facet wrap;
- categorical bars divided into equal dodge slots;
- positive stacked bars using reverse group order;
- bounded jitter around two categorical centers.

The ggplot2 runner writes `*-layer.tsv` data for every example. Scatter, line,
histogram, density, summary, ribbon, tile, heatmap, 2D bin, 2D KDE, contour, count, and facet data give direct
structural references. Dodge and stack are numeric oracles: ScalaFIM uses
zero-based categorical centers, so subtracting one from ggplot2's x
coordinates gives the ScalaFIM centers and bounds. Stack `ymin` and `ymax`
should agree directly. Jitter is a semantic comparison only:
both use the requested half-spread, but ScalaFIM intentionally uses a pure
SplitMix64 generator instead of R's RNG so its offsets are identical on JVM
and Scala.js. Its circles bind the same typed color to stroke and fill
explicitly; no renderer infers plotting semantics.

Pixel identity is not expected. Text metrics, theme spacing, and rasterization
belong to their respective renderers; the visual gate checks geometry,
ordering, clipping, legibility, and absence of collisions or truncation.
