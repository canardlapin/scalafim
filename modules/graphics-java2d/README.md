# scalafim-graphics-java2d

`graphics-java2d` is the JVM raster backend for the renderer-neutral
`graphics` device scene. It compiles scenes into deterministic Java2D commands
and interprets them against `java.awt.Graphics2D`.

Tests combine the shared renderer conformance contract with real
`BufferedImage` pixel assertions. The backend owns Java2D-specific stroke,
font-metric, clipping, transform, and alpha-compositing behavior; it contains no
plot, scale, guide, or layout semantics.
